# CopperCube_AutoCompletion for notepad++
CopperCube game engine autocompletion xml file for notepad++.

This file is Autocompletin file for notepad++ software. You can add this file to Auto completion folder of notepad++.
but before it you should add a new user defined language to notepad++ named "CopperCube" and add keyword list of Coppercube library and do some basic styling for it. You can copy and paste keyword list to 1st group of keywords and set a color for style. Also do some styling for Dafault style.I put keyword list in repo.

Note: you should know that CopperCube scripting language is javaScript. So for CopperCube scripting with notepad++, I suggest to use a combinatin of javascript language and user defined CopperCube language. In order to do this you can first make a basic js file for CopperCube script,such as actions,behaviors and plugins and then change language to your CopperCube language and continue to scripting.
I hope be useful for those who use Coppercube engine make CopperCube scripting easier.Good luck
